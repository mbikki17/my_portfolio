            <h1>SMART PATIENT HEALTH MOINTORING SYSTEM USING IOT</h1>
            <p>Health is the fundamental element of people's needs. Many face unexpected deaths and diseases due to a lack of timely treatment. This project aims to develop a reliable IoT-based patient health monitoring system for healthcare professionals to monitor their patients.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to implement a smart system that monitors heartbeat and body temperature, with various applications in healthcare.</p>  
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) offers a feasible solution for remote health monitoring. It ensures patient data is securely stored in the cloud, reduces hospital stays for routine exams, and allows health monitoring and disease diagnosis by doctors from any location.</p>
            <p>The "Smart Patient Health Monitoring System Using IoT" project facilitates real-time monitoring of patients' health status using IoT technology. It employs sensors to track vital signs like body temperature, blood oxygen levels, and heart rate, as well as environmental factors like room temperature and humidity. An ESP32 microcontroller collects and sends this data to a cloud server for storage, analysis, and visualization. The system focuses on continuous monitoring, with hardware involving sensors connected to the ESP32 board and software development using the Arduino IDE.</p>
