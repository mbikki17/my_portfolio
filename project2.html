            <h1>CMOS NAND DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION USING VIRTUOSO CADENCE TOOL</h1>
            <p>A CMOS NAND gate is a digital logic gate designed using Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which combines NMOS and PMOS transistors to achieve low static power consumption. The two-input CMOS NAND gate consists of two PMOS transistors connected in parallel between the supply voltage (VDD) and the output, and two NMOS transistors connected in series between the output and ground.</p>
           
            <p>Cadence Virtuoso, the primary tool used, offers a comprehensive suite for SoC and IC design, featuring a user-friendly interface, schematic-driven design, simulation tools, layout capabilities, and integration with other EDA tools.

                The project focuses on implementing a CMOS NAND gate, utilizing both NMOS and PMOS transistors for low static power consumption. The design process includes setting up the Cadence environment, creating a library, designing the circuit, and simulating to observe output waveforms. The successful implementation aligns with the expected truth table.</p>
